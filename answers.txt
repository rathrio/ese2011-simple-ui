1. Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)

As the framework receives a HTTP request, the request gets routed to the corresponding action method in a controller class.
Most of the time, there are some methods in a model, which need to be invoked then. So the application code required is executed.
At the end of that specific controller action, there's usually a render() - method, which means, that there is a complex view to be generated.
Therefore, a template file is rendered and the result of that action method gets returned as an HTTP response.

2. How could you test user interfaces with the testing facilities in play! framework?

Selenium tests, which basically test scenarios in your browser when the view is rendered. According to the play! documentation, a selenium test suite is typically written as an HTML file and it even lets you use loops and conditional blocks in order to write more complex tests.
